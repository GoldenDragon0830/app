## GitHub

The initial phase of this project from March 2020 until XX was developed at https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/app and
relied heavily on GitHub features that are not neccessarily preserved in Git metadata:

- Pull requests were generally Squashed and Merged by committers. Most commits in the repository have a number in their subject line. This number identifies the pull request. The original could be found at https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/app/pull/NUMBER - which can show the provenance of the original series of commits finally squashed by maintainers.
- Commits and pull requests often identified Issues that the contribution fully or partially resolved, such as "Closes #X" "Fixes #X" or "Affects #X". The history of these issues can be found at https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/app/issues/NUMBER
